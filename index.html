      Recently, I completed my first year as a <strong>Chemical Engineering</strong> student at <em>Ryerson University</em>.<br>
      Before I head off into my second year, I decided to self-learn how to program my own website using <strong>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</strong> through Github repositories.
